## We are in the process of archiving this repostory - please raise an issue on [mdn/content](https://github.com/mdn/content) instead, thanks

This repository is for documentation, issues, milestones, and other items
used to track the writing and management of content for the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) web developer documentation site. 

Our workflow is optimized around using [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/) to enhance the planning and management of our periodic work sprints, so certain relationships among items are only available if you use Zenhub.

## MDN documentation projects

The MDN team provides developers with the information they need to easily build projects on the web platform. This includes documenting the primary languages and APIs of the Web. To learn more about ongoing work, see the different MDN content areas:

## MDN translations

MDN content can be translated using the MDN wiki editor. This work is a community effort and the MDN team does not work on content translations. Issues related to content translation may be closed.

## Non Web docs

MDN Web Docs still hosts some docs that are not targeted at web developers (such as Mozilla project docs, Firefox build docs, etc.). This content is being archived and no longer maintained on MDN. 

Please file issues on the respective projects instead. Firefox source tree docs are located at https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/, for example.
